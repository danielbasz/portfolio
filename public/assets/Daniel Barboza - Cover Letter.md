Edmonton, Alberta \- July 16th, 2025

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Full Stack Developer position with the Government of Alberta. My journey into software development comes from a lifelong passion for technology, a creative background in digital media, and recent hands-on experience modernizing government systems at the Canada Revenue Agency.

After a successful career in digital content creation and production in Brazil, I immigrated to Canada at the end of 2021 to pursue a Computer Programming diploma at Algonquin College, Ottawa. My technical curiosity began in the 1990s, as the internet and computers became central to daily life. Even working in creative roles, I was always drawn to the technical side, using advanced tools for workflow optimization, never afraid to tinker and try novel approaches, and always seeking new opportunities through being tech-savvy, curious and a fast learner.

At Globo TV, I spearheaded automation initiatives that dramatically reduced manual work in video production. Using python and javascript, the daily time to production for certain products went from 40 to 6 minutes. This re-opened my eyes to the broad application of code in different fields and how programming had evolved since last I saw. This blend of creativity and technical problem-solving inspired me to deepen my programming skills, and when the pandemic hit, I saw the opportunity to transition fully into software development in Canada.

My education at Algonquin College led to a co-op and then a full-time role at the CRA, where I contributed to the modernization of legacy tax auditing systems. In this role, I worked closely with Java and Angular, applying Agile, CI/CD, SDLC and DevOps best practices to deliver robust, scalable applications for government service delivery. While my primary focus was on application development, I also wrote SQL queries and reviewed logs to support development, troubleshoot issues, or help update database schemas as needed. I also implemented automated testing using Jasmine, JUnit, and Playwright, and collaborated closely with clients, product managers, and cross-functional teams to deliver user-centered solutions and clear technical documentation. This experience gave me a strong foundation in both technical problem-solving and effective communication with diverse stakeholders.

While working at CRA, my spouse and I had the privilege of obtaining our permanent residence. However, right before a promotion to CS2, due to federal workforce reductions, there was a pause in bridging for temporary workers into a permanent position, so when my contract concluded, we relocated from Ontario to Alberta. This move was also motivated by my spouse’s opportunity to join Alberta Health Services as a physician. Now happily settled in Edmonton, I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to Alberta’s public sector and to make a meaningful impact in our new home.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background and skills can contribute to your team’s success and to Alberta’s ongoing innovation.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Barboza
