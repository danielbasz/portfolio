Edmonton, AB | 613-406-0962 | hello@danielporto.ca

Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Java Software Developer position at TELUS Health, referred by Evandro Passos. The opportunity to help modernize and transition a critical healthcare application to cloud-based architecture while maintaining full reliability aligns perfectly with my experience and passion for impactful software development.

At the Canada Revenue Agency, I spent over two years developing and maintaining large-scale Java enterprise applications, including legacy Swing systems that mirror your current tech stack. I became skilled at navigating complex codebases, refactoring legacy code, building modern web interfaces with RESTful APIs and sound business logic, while collaborating with cross-functional teams in an Agile environment. I also stepped into Team Lead responsibilities, trained new developers, and consistently delivered features that met strict compliance standards.

What excites me most about this role is the meaningful impact—knowing that the code I write directly supports healthcare providers and patient care across Canada. My spouse is a physician, so this opportunity resonates with me. I bring hands-on experience with the exact technologies you're using, familiarity with AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code and Codex, and a self-starter mindset ready to tackle any new challenge.

Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your engineering team at TELUS.

Sincerely,
Daniel Porto
