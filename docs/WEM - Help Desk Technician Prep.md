## Application Summary

### Cover Letter (Draft)

Daniel Porto
Edmonton, AB | 613-406-0962 | hello@danielporto.ca

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the IT Helpdesk Technician position at West Edmonton Mall. With over two years of experience providing production support for enterprise systems at the Canada Revenue Agency and a Computer Programming diploma, I bring a strong foundation in troubleshooting, technical communication, and end-user support.

At CRA, I participated in on-call rotations supporting critical government applications, where I developed skills in incident management, root cause analysis, and systematic troubleshooting. I regularly collaborated with non-technical stakeholders to explain complex issues in accessible terms, and I created technical documentation to support knowledge sharing across teams. My experience spans hardware and software support, including desktop operating systems, Microsoft 365, and a variety of peripheral devices.

What draws me to this role is the opportunity to directly support the people who keep one of Edmonton's most iconic destinations running smoothly. I thrive in fast-paced environments and take satisfaction in resolving issues efficiently while ensuring users feel supported throughout the process. I am comfortable working independently, prioritizing multiple requests, and escalating appropriately when needed.

I am available for the on-call rotation and able to pass a basic security clearance. Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your IT team.

Sincerely,
Daniel Porto
